# Stormworks-MFD-OS
A full fledged and modular Operating System for 1x1 Screens in Stormworks

How to Use:
  1. Create a Microcontroller with the MainPage as the first Lua script loaded into your 1x1 Screen
  2. Each Menu when pressed will output a constant true Value in their given Order (Pressing the third menu will output true on output 3 etc.)
  3. If you wish to go back to the main menu, restart the microcontroller so the Mainpage gets loaded again
